    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>🙋🏻‍♀️ With a Master of Science in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington, I have honed my craft in web development, ensuring that each line of code contributes to seamless functionality and user satisfaction. At The Weather Company(earlier part of IBM), I design automation flows, build secure API integrations, and develop responsive frontends with clean, maintainable code. My work supports teams across IT operations, HR, asset management, and compliance, streamlining processes and improving internal efficiency.

👊🏼I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of user experience, workflow logic, and backend systems. From onboarding automation to operational dashboards, I’ve delivered solutions that reduce friction and accelerate execution. I also experiment with AI tools to enhance development speed and code quality.

⏳I'm a full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience building internal tools and workflow automations.

👉🏼My expertise lies in crafting user interfaces that are not only intuitive but also robust, evidenced by the automation of API key management for numerous external organizations. This is where my core competencies in NodeJS and Express.js come into play, facilitating external API integrations and optimizing web performance. I am driven by the challenges of the tech landscape and am committed to leveraging my skills to produce impactful digital solutions.

💪🏼Currently, I'm looking to solve harder problems at the intersection of design, platform engineering, and automation — especially where internal tooling and platform reliability directly impact teams and outcomes.
